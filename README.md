## Maths documents for computer science
While self teaching maths, I decided to write documents on all topics I learn in my own words with my own examples, in an easy to understand way 
so any person with no mathematical knowledge is able to read and understand it. All topics are specficially for computer science
## Topics
 - Vectors and matricies
    - Inversion of 2x2 matricies
    - Matrices multiplication, addition and subtraction
    - Transformations of the plane
    - Solving in two simultaneous unkowns
